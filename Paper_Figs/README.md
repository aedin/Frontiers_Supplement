# Impact of Data Preprocessing on Integrative Analysis of Single Cell Data

Code to reproduce the figures from this mini-review article.

## Data preparation

These figures are created using the single cell mixology data from the Tian et al. 2019 paper "Benchmarking single cell RNA-sequencing analysis pipelines using mixture control experiments"
(Data can be downloaded at https://github.com/LuyiTian/sc_mixology/blob/master/data/sincell_with_class.RData)

`data_setup.R` includes the code to further process the data from the Tian et al. paper for input to the figure generation scripts.

## Figure 1

`fig1.R` produces these histograms

## Figure 2

`fig2bc.R` produces the plots for parts b and c
`fig2d.R` produces the plots for part d
